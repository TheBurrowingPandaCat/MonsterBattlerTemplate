This project is attempting to be a thoroughly understandable and modifiable template for creating Monster Battlers in Godot 4.

There are two main principles to follow for the development of this template.
1. Minimize technical debt
  Hacky implementations to get something working and confusing code flows should be documented and/or refactored as soon as possible.
2. Do not abstract before it is necessary
  This will be harder to follow, as this is a template project meant to be universally applicable. That is part of why an open source monster battler is planned to be developed along side this project. Use cases that show up in the open source game are to be implemented as a possible use case in the template.
